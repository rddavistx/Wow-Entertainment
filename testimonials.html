          <p>Randy provided Karaoke for our daughters 10th birthday party. Randy arrived on time, and I was impressed with his lighting and equipment. He had a great selection of music and he did an amazing job keeping the girls engaged and the party moving.
            Thank you Randy for making my daughters birthday party a dream come true, we will be using you again very soon!</p>

          <p>Randy did an excellent job! We chose a mix of artists like Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, De La Soul, and Bell Biv Devoe, as well as Ed Shearan, Cupid, and Panic! At the Disco and he managed to blend them effortlessly so that
            the dance floor always had people on it. He is very reasonably priced, already had the music we requested, and was open both to suggesting songs as well as playing whichever ones we wanted. We had the best time!</p>
